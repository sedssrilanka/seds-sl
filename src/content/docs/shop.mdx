# Administering the E-Commerce Shop

The SEDS platform features a completely integrated Next.js e-commerce storefront, with inventory and orders managed by Payload CMS and user checkout integrated directly.

## 1. Creating Products

1. Navigate to `/admin` and click **Products**.
2. Click **Create New**.

### Pricing

The store supports the local currency (LKR) or USD. Make sure to input values appropriately to ensure correct checkout processing. You can set the price in cents (so `250000` is `$2,500.00` based on the configuration logic) or base integer amounts.

### Inventory Logic

Because products are physical merchandise, check the **Stock Requirements** section to enforce inventory tracking. Setting `"Track Inventory"` on a product ensures people cannot add more items to their cart than are currently available in the database.

## 2. Managing Orders

1. Navigate to the **Orders** section on the left sidebar.
2. Orders generate automatically through the public storefront checkout.

- Each order contains relational references to the purchasing `User`, their selected `Products`, the parsed standard price, and the total cost.
- As an admin, you can view the specific **Status** (e.g., `Pending`, `Shipped`, `Delivered`) to update physical order processing flows over time.

## 3. Categories

Products can be assigned multiple **Categories** (e.g., "Clothing", "Merchandise", "Hardware"). By filling out Categories under the Collections panel, you improve the filter-ability of the frontend Shop interface, allowing users to drill down by product type.
