### Required Fields

- **Title / Name:** What is the project called?
- **Chapter Link:** You can link the project to a specific [Chapter](/docs/chapters). Choose the chapter from the relational dropdown to assign ownership.
- **Divisions:** Assign the project to a specific technical or administrative division (e.g., "Space Sciences", "Rocketry").
- **Hero / Banner Image:** Upload an engaging cover photo.

### The Page Layout Builder

Unlike a simple text description, Projects utilize a dynamic **Layout Builder**.

- Click **"Add Block"** in the layout area.
- You can add rich text blocks, image carousels, call-to-action buttons, and side-by-side media.
- This allows for highly customized articles specifically tailored to the project's needs.

## 3. SEO and Metadata

Scroll down to the **SEO** tab at the bottom of the editor.

- You can customize the `Meta Title` and `Meta Description` to improve how the project appears on Google and when shared on social media like WhatsApp or Twitter.

## 4. Saving and Publishing

When finishing setting up your layout and meta data, make sure to save your work!
