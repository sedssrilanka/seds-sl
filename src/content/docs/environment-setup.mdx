# Environment Variables Setup

This document explains how to set up the environment variables for the SEDS Sri Lanka contact form functionality.

## Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project with the following variables:

### 1. Resend API Configuration

```bash
# Resend API Key for email sending
# Get your API key from https://resend.com/api-keys
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
```

**How to get your Resend API key:**

1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Go to API Keys section in your dashboard
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

### 2. Email Configuration

```bash
# The email address that will receive contact form submissions
CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@seds-sl.org

# The email address that will appear as the sender
# This must be a verified domain in Resend
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@seds-sl.org

# Organization name for email templates
ORG_NAME=SEDS Sri Lanka

# Website URL for email templates
WEBSITE_URL=https://seds-sl.org
```

## Domain Verification

To send emails from your domain, you need to verify it in Resend:

1. Go to your Resend dashboard
2. Navigate to "Domains" section
3. Add your domain (e.g., `seds-sl.org`)
4. Follow the DNS verification steps
5. Once verified, you can use emails from that domain

## Example .env.local File

```bash
# Resend API Key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_1234567890abcdef

# Email Configuration
CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@seds-sl.org
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@seds-sl.org
ORG_NAME=SEDS Sri Lanka
WEBSITE_URL=https://seds-sl.org
```

## Testing

After setting up the environment variables:

1. Restart your development server: `bun run dev`
2. Test the contact form
3. Check your email inbox for the form submission

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Email service not configured" error:**
   - Make sure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Restart your development server after adding the environment variable

2. **"Failed to send email" error:**
   - Check if your domain is verified in Resend
   - Ensure the `FROM_EMAIL` uses a verified domain
   - Verify your API key has the correct permissions

3. **Build errors:**
   - The build will work without environment variables (uses dummy values)
   - For production, make sure all environment variables are set

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control
- Use different API keys for development and production
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Monitor your Resend usage to avoid unexpected charges
